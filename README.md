# Programming-Assignment-5
## User-Level Thread Library 
### Objective
In this project, you will design and implement a user-level thread library which supports thread creation, thread scheduling, thread synchronization, and inter-thread communication (message passing and mailbox) functions.
### Assignment
You will design and implement, in 4 phases, a user-level thread library.
#### Phase 1
* Thread library initialization and shutdown, and thread creation and termination:
  * void t_init(); /* Initialize the thread library by setting up the "running" and the "ready" queues, creating TCB of the "main" thread, and inserting it into the running queue. */
  * void t_shutdown(); /* Shut down the thread library by freeing all the dynamically allocated memory. */
  * int t_create(void (*func)(int), int thr_id, int pri); /* Create a thread with priority pri, start function func with argument thr_id as the thread id. Function func should be of type void func(int). TCB of the newly created thread is added to the end of the "ready" queue; the parent thread calling t_create() continues its execution upon returning from t_create(). */
  * void t_terminate(); /* Terminate the calling thread by removing (and freeing) its TCB from the "running" queue, and resuming execution of the thread in the head of the "ready" queue via setcontext(). Every thread must end (semantically) with a call to t_terminate(). */
  * An initial thread control block (TCB) may look like the following.
       ```
       struct tcb {
	        int thread_id;
          int thread_priority;
	        ucontext_t *thread_context;
	        struct tcb *next;
       };
       typedef struct tcb tcb;
       ```
* Yield the CPU:
  * void t_yield();  /* The calling thread volunarily relinquishes the CPU, and is placed at the end of the ready queue. The first thread (if there is one) in the ready queue resumes execution. */
* Test cases: T1 and T1x
#### Phase 2
* CPU scheduling and time slicing:
  * 2-Level Queue (2LQ) with level 0 (high priority) and 1 (low priority). By default, the main thread is with level 1 (low priority).
  Threads in the low priority queue will be executed only when there is no high priority thread.
  * Round-Robin (RR) scheduler within each level with time quantum of, say, 10,000 microseconds. Use ualarm() to "simulate" timer interrupts so that when a SIGALRM is caught by the signal handler (i.e., the arrival of a timer interrupt), context switching is performed. Notice that right before context switching to a new thread, another SIGALRM needs to be scheduled (via ualarm) as the next timer interrupt. Also, when a thread yields before its time quantum expires, the scheduled SIGALRM should be canceled via ualarm(0,0). The thread library functions of t_init(), t_terminate(), t_shutdown(), and t_yield() should be made atomic by distabling (timer) interrupts via sighold() and sigrelse().
* Test cases: T1a (2LQ), T2 (RR), T4 (RR), and T7 (2LQ)
#### Phase 3
* Thread synchronization with Semaphore:
  * ```int sem_init(sem_t **sp, int sem_count); /* Create a new semaphore pointed to by sp with a count value of sem_count. */```
  * ```void sem_wait(sem_t *sp); /* Current thread does a wait (P) on the specified semaphore. */```
  * ```void sem_signal(sem_t *sp); /* Current thread does a signal (V) on the specified semaphore. Follow the Mesa semantics (p. 9 of Chapter 30 Condition Variables) where the thread that signals continues, and the first waiting (blocked) thread (if there is any) becomes ready. */```
  * ```void sem_destroy(sem_t **sp); /* Destroy (free) any state related to specified semaphore. */```
  * Semaphore type sem_t is defined as follows.
       ```
       typedef struct {
         int count;
         tcb *q;
       } sem_t;
       ```
* sample thread library where applications include ud_thread.h
* Test cases: T3, T10, Shone-Hoffman (output), and Dining Philosophers [4 sample outputs (where all philosophers ate in the 4th run)]
#### Phase 4
* Inter-thread communications:
  * mailbox:
    * ```int mbox_create(mbox **mb); /* Create a mailbox pointed to by mb. */```
    * ```void mbox_destroy(mbox **mb); /* Destroy any state related to the mailbox pointed to by mb. */```
    * ```void mbox_deposit(mbox *mb, char *msg, int len); /* Deposit message msg of length len into the mailbox pointed to by mb. */```
    * ```void mbox_withdraw(mbox *mb, char *msg, int *len); /* Withdraw the first message from the mailbox pointed to by mb into msg and set the message's length in len accordingly. The caller of mbox_withdraw() is responsible for allocating the space in which the received message is stored. If there is no message in the mailbox, len is set to 0. Notice that mbox_withdraw() is not blocking, i.e., mbox_withdraw() returns immediately if there is no message available in the specified mailbox. Even if more than one message awaits the caller, only one message is returned per call to mbox_withdraw(). Messages are withdrew in the order in which they were deposited. */```
    * An initial mailbox may look like the following.
       ```
       struct messageNode {
         char *message;     // copy of the message 
         int  len;          // length of the message 
         int  sender;       // TID of sender thread 
         int  receiver;     // TID of receiver thread 
         struct messageNode *next; // pointer to next node 
       };
	 
       typedef struct {
	        struct messageNode *msg;       // message queue
	        sem_t *mbox_sem;
       } mbox;
       ```
    * Test cases: T6
  * message passing:
    * ```void send(int tid, char *msg, int len); /* Send a message to the thread whose tid is tid. msg is the pointer to the start of the message, and len specifies the length of the message in bytes. In your implementation, all messages are character strings. */```
    * ```void receive(int *tid, char *msg, int *len); /* Wait for and receive a message from another thread. The caller has to specify the sender's tid in tid, or sets tid to 0 if it intends to receive a message sent by any thread. If there is no "matching" message to receive, the calling thread waits (i.e., blocks itself). [A sending thread is responsible for waking up a waiting, receiving thread.] Upon returning, the message is stored starting at msg. The tid of the thread that sent the message is stored in tid, and the length of the message is stored in len. The caller of receive() is responsible for allocating the space in which the message is stored. Even if more than one message awaits the caller, only one message is returned per call to receive(). Messages are received in the order in which they were sent. The caller will not resume execution until it has received a message (blocking receive). */```
    * Note: send() and receive() together are termed asynchronous communication.
    * Test cases: T5 and T8 
    * Notes on "message passing" implementation: You may implement Phase 4 through the following two intermediate steps,
      * Non-blocking receive() 
          
        When a thread executes a non-blocking receive(), the receive() function goes through the thread's message queue and looks for the first "matching" message. If there exists such a matching message, copies it to the space allocated, deletes the message from the message queue, and returns. If no such message, simply returns. Of course, you have to use a binary semaphore [from Phase 3] as a lock to protect the examining and dequeuing process. 
        
        The send() function simply enqueues the sent message to the receiving thread's message queue. Of course, you will need to lock such an enqueue operation. 
        
        Since there is no blocking involved, you don't need to use any semaphore to block any thread.
      * Non-discriminatory, blocking receive() 
        
        In this version of receive(), receive() ignores the sender's tid and simply returns the first message (if there is one) in the message queue. However, when receive() is executed but there is no message in the message queue, the invoking thread (executing inside the receive() function) is blocked. To implement such blocking, you use a counting semaphore [from Phase 3]. 
        
        Now, the send() function, when invoked by a sending thread, not only enqueues the message, but also "signals" the receiving thread's counting semaphore to wake it up (if the receiving thread is currently blocked). Notice that threads could send messages to a receiving thread at any time so that multiple messages may have been enqueued in a receiving thread's message buffer before the receiving thread even executes a receive(). For instance, send() may have been invoked 3 times (from the same or different threads) so the the receiving thread's semaphore has been signaled 3 times to raise the value of the semaphore to 3! Now when the receiving thread executes receive(), it does sem_wait() and dequeue the first message. Since the semaphore value is not negative, the receiving thread continues and returns from receive() [without blocking]. Given that there are 3 messages in the queue originally, the receiving thread could execute receive() 3 times without being blocked. However, when the 4th receive() is executed, the receiving thread blocks waiting for the next (4th) message to wake it up.

      Extra Credits [rendezvous -- synchronous communication] (Refer to Question #2, Chapter 31 Semaphores) 
    * ```void block_send(int tid, char *msg, int length); /* Send a message and wait for reception. The same as send(), except that the caller does not return until the destination thread has received the message. */```
    * ```void block_receive(int *tid, char *msg, int *length); /* Wait for and receive a message; the same as receive(), except that the caller (a receiver) also needs to specify the sender. */```
    * Test cases: T9 and T11
### How to get started
Start the project from the sample thread library (a tar file).
  * Context: Use getcontext() and setcontext() within the same thread (let's loop)
  * Switching between threads : Use getcontext()/setcontext()/swapcontext() system calls. 
  (sample swapcontext code and its execution trace) 
  (sample swapcontext via yield code)
  * Creating a new thread: Use makecontext() system call.
  * Scheduling: Use ualarm()and a signal handler that catches SIGALRM and schedules the next thread in accordance with the scheduling policy. Use sigrelse(3c)/sighold(3c) to make thread library APIs atomic. (sample alarm code) (example critical section code by Sean Krail)
  * Semaphore : Atomic execution of wait and signal must be enforced. This can be achieved by disabling and enabling "interrupts" via sighold(3c) and sigrelse(3c), respectively.
### Test Runs
The TA will use the test programs T1, T1x, T1a, T2, T2a, T3, T4, T5, T6, T7, T8, T9, T10, and T11, to test your code against outputs 1, 1x, 1a, 2, 2a, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 or 9.alt, 10, and 11 or 11.alt, and may use other test programs as well.
Blocking send/receive: [9 with active V], [9 with passive V], [11 with active V], [11 with passive V]
